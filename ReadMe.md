## Online TODO List 
Online TODO List is a simple web application built using ASP.NET MVC Core that can run in all web browsers. The application has a support for Sign up and Sign In which is implemented using Microsoft Identity (Azure AD B2C), and the app stores the data in an in-memory database.

## Reference
I have referred this [Git repo - (Microsoft Azure Sample)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2)  to configure Identity & Access Management (IAM) in Azure AD B2C and to build this sample I have copy-paste some code from this Git branch which microsoft have granted permission to use, copy code and modified it as required
